This project is simply a hobby project that I made for me and my friends. It can be used to keep track of scores during golf and disc golf. Simply add new players, and then start the game! At the end, you can submit to see everyone's score and rank through the game.

Currently working on:
    Implementing Google Sign-In for users to store player's highscores.
