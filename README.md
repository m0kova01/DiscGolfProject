This project is simply a hobby project that I made for me and my friends. It can be used to keep track of scores during golf and disc golf. Simply add new players, and then start the game! At the end, you can submit to see everyone's score and rank throughout the game. Visit https://m0kova01.github.io/DiscGolfProject/home to see the lastest deployed version. (NOTE: If this site shows a white page, it is currently being updated by github. Come back in a few minutes to see what has changed!)
